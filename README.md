# Netstorm FreePlay Campaign

This is a collection of edited maps for [Netstorm: Islands at War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetStorm:_Islands_At_War).

There's no lore, story, or anything like that. These are just generated maps for the purpose of single playing. Some of them are inspired in what a multiplayer game would be.

## Instructions

Extract these files in NetStorm's `d\` subfolder.

For example:

    C:\Program Files(x86)\NetStorm\d\

There shall be a new campaign in the campaign menu named **NetStorm Free Play**.

## Notes

See the **LICENSE** file in this repository.

I would like to thank Netstorm World and Netstorm Head Quarters for all those years of mantaining the community.

This was made to be shown at the [netstorm subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/netstorm).
